View Introspector is a desktop app for the iOS Simulator that aid in debugging user interfaces built with UIKit. It's especially useful for UI layouts that are dynamically created or can change during runtime.

It uses keyboard shortcuts to handle starting, ending and other commands.  It can also be invoked via an app-wide `UIGestureRecognizer` if it is to be used on the device.

Features:
--------------
* Simple to setup and use
* See the entire hierarchy (view tree) of the window
* Send messages (call any method) to the selected view during runtime
* Displays a views origin & size, including distances to edges of main window
* Displays properties of a view, including subclass properties, actions and targets (see below for an example)
* Displays accessibility properties â€” useful for UI automation scripts
* Move and resize view frames during runtime
* Highlighting of view frames

* Start your app
* Start `View Introspector` desktop app
* Install [CBIntrospector](https://github.com/cbess/CBIntrospector/) iOS lib

Before you start, make sure the `DEBUG` environment variable is set. CBIntrospect will not run without that set to prevent it being left in for production use.

Provide custom name of view:

    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [super viewDidLoad];

        // provide custom names for use by the View Introspector desktop app and console output
    	[[CBIntrospect sharedIntrospector] setName:@"myActivityIndicator" forObject:self.activityIndicator accessedWithSelf:YES];
        [[CBIntrospect sharedIntrospector] setNameForViewController:self];
    }
